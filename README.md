# Pokémon Data Analysis Project

This project explores Pokémon data using SQL and Tableau. It includes questions around stats, typing, rarity, and trends across generations to uncover game design patterns and strategic insights.

## 🔧 Tools Used
- MySQL
- Tableau
- GitHub
- Google Docs

## 🧠 Project Overview

Inspired by my niece and nephew’s love of Pokémon, this project analyzes over 1,000 Pokémon (as of March 2025) to answer questions like:

- What are the most common type combinations?
- How do average stats evolve by generation?
- What percentage of Pokémon are Legendary?
- Which types tend to have higher Attack or Defense?
- Are dual-type Pokémon statistically stronger than single-types?

## 📊 Key Insights

- **Normal** is the most common single type, with 75 base-form Pokémon
- **Dual-types** make up over 55% of Pokémon, showcasing the game’s complexity
- Legendary Pokémon represent a small fraction (~X%), but dominate stat rankings
- Average base stats have increased over time, suggesting power creep

## 📌 Conclusion

This project showcases how structured queries and visual dashboards can extract meaningful patterns from complex data. It demonstrates practical SQL, Tableau, and data storytelling skills.
